If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. This element has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueString, valueBoolean, valueRange, valueRatio, valueSampledData, valueAttachment, valueTime, valueDateTime, or valuePeriod. (The name format is "'value' + the type name" with a capital on the first letter of the type).
   * 
   * If the data element is usually coded or if the type associated with the Observation.value defines a coded value, use CodeableConcept instead of string datatype even if the value is uncoded text.  A value set is bound to the ValueCodeableConcept element.    For further discussion and examples see the  [notes section](observation.html#notes) below.

   * Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  "detected", "not detected", "inconclusive", or  "specimen unsatisfactory".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code "error" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when &gt; 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.
