For example a pill pack of 21 tablets plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as '28 tablets'. This attribute is repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not '2 tubes and 3 tubes'). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource.
