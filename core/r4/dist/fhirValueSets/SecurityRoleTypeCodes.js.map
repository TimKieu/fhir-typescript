The FHIR Actor value set is based on    DICOM Audit Message, C402;   ASTM Standard, E1762-95 [2013]; selected codes and          derived actor roles from HL7 RoleClass OID 2.16.840.1.113883.5.110;    HL7 Role Code 2.16.840.1.113883.5.111, including AgentRoleType;          HL7 ParticipationType OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.90; and    HL7 ParticipationFunction codes OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.88.           This value set includes, by reference, role codes from external code systems: NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.101;          North American Industry Classification System [NAICS]OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.85; IndustryClassificationSystem 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.16039;          and US Census Occupation Code OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.243 for relevant recipient or custodian codes not included in this value set.            If no source is indicated in the definition comments, then these are example FHIR codes.          It can be extended with appropriate roles described by SNOMED as well as those described in the HL7 Role Based Access Control Catalog and the          HL7 Healthcare (Security and Privacy) Access Control Catalog.            In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), permissions are operations on an object that a user wishes to access. Permissions are grouped into roles.          A role characterizes the functions a user is allowed to perform. Roles are assigned to users. If the user's role has the appropriate permissions          to access an object, then that user is granted access to the object. FHIR readily enables RBAC, as FHIR Resources are object types and the CRUDE          events (the FHIR equivalent to permissions in the RBAC scheme) are operations on those objects.          In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), a user requests to perform operations on objects. That user's access request is granted or denied          based on a set of access control policies that are specified in terms of attributes and conditions. FHIR readily enables ABAC, as instances of          a Resource in FHIR (again, Resources are object types) can have attributes associated with them. These attributes include security tags,          environment conditions, and a host of user and object characteristics, which are the same attributes as those used in ABAC. Attributes help          define the access control policies that determine the operations a user may perform on a Resource (in FHIR) or object (in ABAC). For example,          a tag (or attribute) may specify that the identified Resource (object) is not to be further disclosed without explicit consent from the patient.\r\n */\r\nexport const SecurityRoleTypeCodes = {\r\n  /**\r\n   * _CitizenRoleType: A role type used to qualify a person's legal status within a country or nation.\r\n   */\r\n  CitizenRoleType: \"_CitizenRoleType\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * 110150: Audit participant role ID of software application\r\n   */\r\n  Application: \"110150\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * 110151: Audit participant role ID of software application launcher, i.e., the entity that started or stopped an application\r\n   */\r\n  ApplicationLauncher: \"110151\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * 110152: Audit participant role ID of the receiver of data\r\n   */\r\n  DestinationRoleID: \"110152\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * 110153: Audit participant role ID of the sender of data\r\n   */\r\n  SourceRoleID: \"110153\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * 110154: Audit participant role ID of media receiving data during an export\r\n   */\r\n  DestinationMedia: \"110154\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * 110155: Audit participant role ID of media providing data during an import\r\n   */\r\n  SourceMedia: \"110155\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * AFFL: Player of the Affiliate role has a business/professional relationship with scoper.

The claims adjuster for the policy underwriter will review the claim to determine whether the loss meets the benefit coverage criteria under a policy, and base any indemnification or coverage payment on that review.  If a third party is liable in whole or part for the loss, the underwriter may pursue third party liability recovery.  A claimant may be involved in civil or criminal legal proceedings involving claims against a defendant party that is indemnified by an insurance policy or to protest the finding of a claims adjustor. With respect to life insurance, a beneficiary designated by a named insured becomes a claimant of the proceeds of coverage, as in the case of a life insurance policy.  However, a claimant for coverage under life insurance is not necessarily a designated beneficiary.\r\n   * \r\n   *                         \r\n   *                            Note: A claimant is not a named insured.  However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., an insured driver may make a claim for an injury under his or her comprehensive automobile insurance policy.  Similarly, a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.\r\n   * \r\n   *                         In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that either a named insured or an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss.  In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a \"claim\" under the program for benefits.  Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.\r\n   * \r\n   *                         \r\n   *                            Example: A claimant under automobile policy that is not the named insured.\r\n   */\r\n  Claimant: \"CLAIM\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * CLASSIFIER: An individual authorized to assign an original classification to information, including compilations of unclassified information, based on a determination that the information requires protection against unauthorized disclosure.

The FHIR Actor value set is based on    DICOM Audit Message, C402;   ASTM Standard, E1762-95 [2013]; selected codes and          derived actor roles from HL7 RoleClass OID 2.16.840.1.113883.5.110;    HL7 Role Code 2.16.840.1.113883.5.111, including AgentRoleType;          HL7 ParticipationType OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.90; and    HL7 ParticipationFunction codes OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.88.           This value set includes, by reference, role codes from external code systems: NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.101;          North American Industry Classification System [NAICS]OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.85; IndustryClassificationSystem 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.16039;          and US Census Occupation Code OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.243 for relevant recipient or custodian codes not included in this value set.            If no source is indicated in the definition comments, then these are example FHIR codes.          It can be extended with appropriate roles described by SNOMED as well as those described in the HL7 Role Based Access Control Catalog and the          HL7 Healthcare (Security and Privacy) Access Control Catalog.            In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), permissions are operations on an object that a user wishes to access. Permissions are grouped into roles.          A role characterizes the functions a user is allowed to perform. Roles are assigned to users. If the user's role has the appropriate permissions          to access an object, then that user is granted access to the object. FHIR readily enables RBAC, as FHIR Resources are object types and the CRUDE          events (the FHIR equivalent to permissions in the RBAC scheme) are operations on those objects.          In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), a user requests to perform operations on objects. That user's access request is granted or denied          based on a set of access control policies that are specified in terms of attributes and conditions. FHIR readily enables ABAC, as instances of          a Resource in FHIR (again, Resources are object types) can have attributes associated with them. These attributes include security tags,          environment conditions, and a host of user and object characteristics, which are the same attributes as those used in ABAC. Attributes help          define the access control policies that determine the operations a user may perform on a Resource (in FHIR) or object (in ABAC). For example,          a tag (or attribute) may specify that the identified Resource (object) is not to be further disclosed without explicit consent from the patient.\r\n */\r\nexport type SecurityRoleTypeCodeType = typeof SecurityRoleTypeCodes[keyof typeof SecurityRoleTypeCodes];\r\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;;AAEG;AACU,IAAA,qBAAqB,GAAG;AACnC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,eAAe,EAAE,kBAAkB;AACnC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,WAAW,EAAE,QAAQ;AACrB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,mBAAmB,EAAE,QAAQ;AAC7B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,iBAAiB,EAAE,QAAQ;AAC3B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,QAAQ;AACtB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,gBAAgB,EAAE,QAAQ;AAC1B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,WAAW,EAAE,QAAQ;AACrB;;;;;AAKG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;AACjB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,KAAK,EAAE,MAAM;AACb;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,SAAS;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,cAAc,EAAE,UAAU;AAC1B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,4BAA4B,EAAE,MAAM;AACpC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,yCAAyC,EAAE,MAAM;AACjD;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAmBG;AACH,IAAA,gBAAgB,EAAE,KAAK;AACvB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,mBAAmB,EAAE,YAAY;AACjC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,2BAA2B,EAAE,MAAM;AACnC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,2BAA2B,EAAE,MAAM;AACnC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAAK;AACnB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,uBAAuB,EAAE,MAAM;AAC/B;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAaG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,OAAO;AACjB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,UAAU,EAAE,YAAY;AACxB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;AACd;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,sCAAsC,EAAE,MAAM;AAC9C;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,2CAA2C,EAAE,OAAO;AACpD;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,QAAQ;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,WAAW;AACtB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,cAAc,EAAE,SAAS;AACzB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;AACf;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,aAAa,EAAE,QAAQ;AACvB;;;;;;;AAOG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,QAAQ;AACtB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,mBAAmB,EAAE,MAAM;AAC3B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,mCAAmC,EAAE,KAAK;AAC1C;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,wCAAwC,EAAE,MAAM;AAChD;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,KAAK;AAChB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,aAAa,EAAE,eAAe;AAC9B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,aAAa,EAAE,eAAe;AAC9B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,WAAW,EAAE,aAAa;AAC1B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,cAAc;AAC5B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,WAAW;AACtB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,WAAW;AACtB;;;;;;;;AAQG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,OAAO;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,UAAU,EAAE,WAAW;AACvB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,sBAAsB,EAAE,SAAS;AACjC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,gBAAgB,EAAE,MAAM;AACxB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,KAAK;AACf;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,QAAQ;AACtB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,gBAAgB,EAAE,QAAQ;AAC1B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,SAAS;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,SAAS;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,IAAI;AACf;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SAAS;AAC1B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,OAAO;AACjB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,yBAAyB,EAAE,SAAS;AACpC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,WAAW;AACtB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,KAAK;AAChB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,WAAW,EAAE,UAAU;AACvB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,oBAAoB,EAAE,QAAQ;AAC9B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,oBAAoB,EAAE,MAAM;AAC5B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE,IAAI;AACxB;;;;;;;;;;;AAWG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,OAAO;AACrB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,KAAK;AAChB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAAK;AACnB;;;;;AAKG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,KAAK;AACd;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,eAAe,EAAE,QAAQ;AACzB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,aAAa,EAAE,UAAU;AACzB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,+BAA+B,EAAE,QAAQ;AACzC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE,MAAM;AAC1B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,gBAAgB,EAAE,SAAS;AAC3B;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,UAAU;AACpB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,MAAM,EAAE,QAAQ;AAChB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,sBAAsB,EAAE,SAAS;AACjC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,WAAW,EAAE,OAAO;AACpB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,KAAK;AACd;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,OAAO;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,MAAM;AAChB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,KAAK;;;;;"}
