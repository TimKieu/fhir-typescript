(E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown')\r\n   *                            Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown.  (E.g. specifying a use code of \"H\" and a URL prefix of \"tel:\" to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)\r\n   */\r\n  Unknown: \"UNK\",\r\n  /**\r\n   * W: The spouse has died\r\n   */\r\n  Widowed: \"W\",\r\n} as const;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * This value set defines the set of codes that can be used to indicate the marital status of a person.\r\n */\r\nexport type MaritalStatusCodeType = typeof MaritalStatusCodes[keyof typeof MaritalStatusCodes];\r\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;;AAEG;AACU,IAAA,kBAAkB,GAAG;AAChC;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,GAAG;AACb;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,GAAG;AACb;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,aAAa,EAAE,GAAG;AAClB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,gBAAgB,EAAE,GAAG;AACrB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;AACZ;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,UAAU,EAAE,GAAG;AACf;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,YAAY,EAAE,GAAG;AACjB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,eAAe,EAAE,GAAG;AACpB;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,SAAS,EAAE,GAAG;AACd;;;;;;;;;AASG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,KAAK;AACd;;AAEG;AACH,IAAA,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;;;;;"}
